# MEMORY POOL
# 'Capacity' affects the hugepage memory usage. 2^q-1 is optimal.
# Each NUMA socket has its own mempool with the given name.
Mempool:
  DIRECT:  # RX incoming packets
    Capacity: 524287
    Dataroom: 2176
  INDIRECT:  # indirect mbufs
    Capacity: 1048575
  NAME:  # name linearize
    Capacity: 65535
  HEADER:  # TX packet headers
    Capacity: 65535
  GUIDER:  # TX modified Interest guiders (forwarder only)
    Capacity: 65535
  INT:  # TX Interests (traffic generator only)

# LCORE ALLOCATION
# This is a mapping from LCore role to its reservations.
# Roles for ndnfw-dpdk: RX, TX, CRYPTO, FWD.
# Roles for ndnping-dpdk: RX, TX, SVR, CLIR, CLIT.
# Within each role:
#  - 'lcores' is a list of lcores reserved for that role.
#  - 'pernuma' is a map of { NumaSocket => max number of lcores } for that role.
# Leaving this section blank results in automatic allocation.
LCoreAlloc:
# ROLE1: # this role can use lcore 1 and lcore 3
#   lcores: [1, 3]
# ROLE2: # this role can have up to 3 and 2 lcores on two NUMA sockets
#   pernuma:
#     0: 3
#     1: 2
